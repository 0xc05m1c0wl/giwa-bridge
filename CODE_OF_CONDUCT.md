# Code of Conduct

Treat everyone with respect. Harassment, discrimination, and abusive behavior are not tolerated.

Maintainers may edit, remove, or reject content and restrict contributors when behavior violates this policy.

Report issues via repository issues. For security-related concerns, use Security Advisories instead of public issues.
